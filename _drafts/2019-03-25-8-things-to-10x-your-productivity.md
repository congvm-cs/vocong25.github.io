# How To Improve Your Blog Writing Skills?

The vast majority of content online is poorly written. Most articles are rushed, have not been researched thoroughly, do not convey a message, and do not cite sources. A large percentage of articles have also been **spun** specially for search engines, which means the quanlity of the article was never even a consideration.

There is a myth that I encounter frequently that you are either a good writer or a bad writer. I do not believe this to be true.

My writing skills only started to improve when I began to blog everyday. This got me into the habit of writing and perhaps more important, reviewing my writing more. To this day, I continue to review my writing and improve upon what I consider to be my weaknesses.
