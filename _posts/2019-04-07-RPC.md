# RPC - Remote Procedure Call

## 1. Introduction

In this post, I am going to learn about RPC which one kind of mediums that make my microservice talk to each other at lightspeed.

## 2. Contents

#### 2.1. The protocol

The protocol itself based on  http2, so some feature of RPC are inherited by this one, such as compressing headers, persistant single TCP connections, cancellation and timeout contracts between client and server.

The protocol has built in flow control from http2 and data frame. This is very handy for insuring clients respect the throughput of your system. 

Load balancing is normally performed by the clients, which chooses the server for a given request from a list provided by a Load Balancing server.

### 2.2. RPC Types

RPC offers two essential types for client server communications.

#### 2.2.1. Unary

Essentially there are synchronous requests made to the RPC server with a single request the blocks until a reponse is received.

#### 2.2.2. Streaming

Streaming is accomplished in three different configurations:

1. Clients push  messages to the stream
2. Server push messages the the stream
3. Both client and server send data in two streams in the same method.

#### 2.2.3. The protobuf file

The protobuf defines how to interpret messages and allows the developer to create stubs that make encoding and decoding these values quick and  efficients.

In thrift, there is TBinaryProtocol which works like the protobuf.

#### 2.2. Processing

**When making a RPC**

The following steps take place during the RPC:

1. A client invokes a **client stub procedure**, passing parameters in the usual way. The client stub resides within the client's own address space.
2. The client stub **marshalls (packs)** the parameters into the message. Marshalling includes converting the presentation of the parameters into a [**standard format**](), and copying each parameter into the message.
3. The client stub passes the message to the [**transport layer**](), which sends it to the remote server machine.
4. On the server, the transport layer passes the message to the a sever stubs, which **demarshalls(unpacks)** the parameters and calls the desired server routine using the **regular procedure call mechanism**(this is your processing procedure or your handler).
5. When the server procedures completes, it returns to the server stub (via a **normal procedure call return**), which marshalls the return values into a message. The server stub the hands the message to the transport layer.
6. The transport layer sends the result message back to the client transport layer, which hands the message back to the client stub.


### Some notations
1. RPC Run time:

RPC run time system, is a library of routines and a set of services that handle the network communications that underlie the RPC mechanism. In the course of an RPC call client-side and server-side run-time systems code handle binding, establish communications over an appropriate protocol, pass call data between the client and server, and handle communications errors.

2. Stub:

The function of the stubs is to provide transparency to the programmer-written application code.

On the client side, the stub handles the interface between the client's local procedure call and the run-time system, marshaling and unmarshaling data, invoking the RPC run-time protocol, and if requested, carrying out some of the binding steps.

On the server side, the stubs provides the similar interface between the run-time system and the local manager procedures that are executed by the server.

3. Binding: How does the client know how to call, and where the service resides?

The most flexible solution is to use dynamic binding and find the server at run time when RPC is first made. The first time client stub is invoked, it contacts name server to determine the transport address at which the server resides.

Binding consists 2 parts:
- Naming: 

Remote procedures are named through interfaces. **An interface uniquely identifies a particular service, describing the types and numbers of its arguments**. It is similar in purpose to a type definition in programming languages.

- Locating:

Finding the transport address at which the server actually resides. Once we have the transport address of the service, we can send messages directly to the server.
